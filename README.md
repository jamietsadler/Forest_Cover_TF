# Forest_Cover_TF
Predicting forest cover type using TF.
Uses Tensorflow to predixt forest cover type using cartogrpahic variables. 
The cover types are the following:
  Spruce/Fir,
  Lodgepole Pine,
  Ponderosa Pine,
  Cottonwood/Willow,
  Aspen,
  Douglas-fir,
  Krummholz.
 
 Independent variables were then derived from data obtained from the US Geological Survey and USFS. The data is raw and has not been scaled or preprocessed for you. It contains binary columns of data for qualitative independent variables such as wilderness areas and soil type.

This study area includes four wilderness areas located in the Roosevelt National Forest of northern Colorado. These areas represent forests with minimal human-caused disturbances, so existing forest cover types are mainly a result of ecological processes rather than forest management practices.
